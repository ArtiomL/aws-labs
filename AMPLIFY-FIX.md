At the amplify CLI page (https://webapp.serverlessworkshops.io/usermanagement/amplifycli/) for workaround the failed installation of amplify
```
wget https://package.cli.amplify.aws/9.1.0/amplify-pkg-linux-x64.tgz
tar xvf amplify-pkg-linux-x64.tgz
./amplify-pkg-linux-x64 init
./amplify-pkg-linux-x64 version
```


Note that it makes you work with ./amplify-pkg-linux-x64 without the command (I have to fix it).
